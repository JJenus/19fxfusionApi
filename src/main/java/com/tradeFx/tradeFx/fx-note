Certainly, let's consider the changes in balance independently for each position as the market moves.

1. **Long Position:**
   - Initial balance: $1000
   - Open Long trade: Buy 0.02 lots at $10 per lot
   - Used margin: $0.02 * $10 = $0.2
   - Remaining balance: $1000 - $0.2 = $999.8

If the market moves in favor of the Long position:
- Let's say the market price increases to $11.
- Profit from the Long position: ($11 - $10) * 0.02 = $0.02
- New balance: $999.8 + $0.02 = $999.82

If the market moves against the Long position:
- Let's say the market price decreases to $9.
- Loss from the Long position: ($9 - $10) * 0.02 = -$0.02
- New balance: $999.8 - $0.02 = $999.78

2. **Short Position:**
   - Initial balance: $999.8 (updated from the Long position)
   - Open Short trade: Sell 0.02 lots at $10 per lot
   - Used margin: $0.02 * $10 = $0.2
   - Remaining balance: $999.8 + $0.2 = $1000

If the market moves in favor of the Short position:
- Let's say the market price decreases to $9.
- Profit from the Short position: ($10 - $9) * 0.02 = $0.02
- New balance: $1000 + $0.02 = $1000.02

If the market moves against the Short position:
- Let's say the market price increases to $11.
- Loss from the Short position: ($10 - $11) * 0.02 = -$0.02
- New balance: $1000 - $0.02 = $999.98

These calculations show how the balance changes independently for each position as the market moves in either direction.
